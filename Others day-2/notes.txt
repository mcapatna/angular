Ruby on rail is on server side
MVC 
	Model=Data,Business Logic,Validation 
	Controller = incharge of Application Logic/Flow
	View=Intract with the User UI rendering & user Input
IN MVP controller becomes less powerful Controller does not have the power to transfer/decision
MVVM model view view model = Have some data and some function assosiated witht the data for example silverlight,knowkout
angular can used all the 3 framework so it can be considered as MV-* pattern.
==============
angular file is very heavy so suggested to load at the end of the page
"use script" will enforce you to declare the java script variable before use.
module is the root of angular.at least of one module shoule.
angular.module("app",[]); first search for the module name app if not find will create the module. [] contains the dependency to run the module.
for example there are 2 modules AppModules & accModule in which AppModule is depndendent on accModule.

index.html-->AppModule-->AccModule
To decalre AccModule==>angular.module("accModule",[]);-->searching for AccModule
To decalre AppModule==>angular.module("AppModule",[accModule]);

Creation of Controller
-----------------------------
		  
moduleName.controller("controllerName" annonymus function)
scope is a predefined service by angular which allow to interconnect both controller & view
if a controller needs some predefine service give it inside the function as an argument
For example
		angular.module("app",[]).controller("DemoController",function DemoController($scope){
			$scope.message="Hello Bro...";

		  });



If you want to execute the angular in a div use ng-app.
To call a controller use ng-controller 
{{}} is just like JSTL of JSP 
Example
	<div ng-app="app">
		<div ng-controller="DemoController">
			{{message}}
		</div>
	</div>

ParseInt used to parse the text to String toString ()used to convert the String int int
